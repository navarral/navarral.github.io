				<h2>TinyTrend research project</h2>
				<p>Welcome to TinyTrend! This research project aims to identify new environmental causes of premature birth by integrating text mining with epidemiological analyses. The project will combine population-wide health data from Lombardy, Italy, comprising 1 million pregnancies between 2012-2023, with insights derived from AI about changes in environmental policies in the same period. This work is funded by the European Union under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) postdoctoral fellowship program (ID: <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101153708">101153708</a>).</p>

					<p>A researcher working with health data needs to gather, analyse and link information about people and their health to help improve healthcare and make it better for everyone. These tasks require a combination of Maths, Statistics, technology and knowledge about the health domain to manage the very large amounts of different health datasets with pieces of information about our health.
					<br>
					<br>
					In this blog, I'll touch briefly on some key chapters of my journey. If any part of my story resonates with you, let me know as I’d be happy to expand on it in a full blog post if it would be helpful!</p>

                <h2>Chapter 1: Nanotechnology</h2>
                
                <p>Fresh out of school, I wanted to study life sciences in University but I was unsure of which one to choose. I was a good student in school but not an excellent one, which made difficult getting into medicine in Barcelona. When trying to select the next best option, I stumbled upon Nanotechnology (what a cool name I thought!). Nanotechnology involves studying and manipulating materials at the nanoscale, combining my favourite subjects of physics, chemistry, biology, and math to create advanced technologies in various fields. I ended up enjoying this degree, and I would do it again in a heartbeat, for both the degree and the people I met along the way.</p>
                
                <p>The most valuable takeaway from this degree was learning to solve complex problems within interdisciplinary teams. I gained the ability to understand colleagues from diverse backgrounds, even without mastering a single discipline – just their interactions. However, I felt I lacked experience in optimizing parameters, making data-driven decisions, and working with large datasets to model outcomes.</p>
                
                <h2>Chapter 2: Data modelling</h2>
                
                <p>I decided to take a couple of classes on environmental modelling during my Erasmus in Ghent to overcome my lack of data modelling skills and … I loved it! We were able to simplify a system and even do some predictions at the click of a button. No need to process 100 samples to find a good enough reagent while wearing a lab coat or these funny plastic gloves. I was in for a treat. I rapidly start catching up with coding in R and enrolled in data modelling master’s also in Barcelona. I was the only one from Nanotechnology that had chosen this route as most of my friends decided to do material sciences, biomedicine, biotechnology or take a gap year.</p>
                
                <p>During my master’s thesis, I had the chance to work with one of the top Climate and Health teams at ISGlobal in Barcelona. My supervisors, Xavier Rodó and Silvia Borràs, were incredibly passionate about research, and the enthusiasm was contagious. We investigated whether the composition of air masses could be linked to a rise in Kawasaki Disease cases in Japan. That’s when it clicked – I knew I wanted to do everything I could to pursue a career in research.</p>
                
                <h2>Chapter 3: Computer Science</h2>
                
                <p>When I first applied for a PhD position in Dublin through the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN), I wasn’t sure what to expect. The first interview didn’t go well as I struggled with the statistical questions, and nerves got the best of me. I left feeling disappointed, convinced I had missed my chance. But then something unexpected happened. One of the interviewers, Declan O’Sullivan, saw potential in me and suggested I apply for another position in Dublin. This position was in health data linkage using Semantic Web technologies, a field I knew nothing about.</p>
                
                <p>People always say that choosing the right PhD supervisor is just as important as choosing the topic itself. I knew he was one of the good ones after having a Skype chat together. This was one of the best decisions I ever made!</p>
                
                <p>The ITN provided me the opportunity to work with leading research teams in the health domain: epidemiology (Climate and Health group in ISGlobal Barcelona), rare disease research (Rare Kidney Disease group in Trinity College Dublin), health data governance (European Institute for Innovation through Health Data in Belgium), health data linkage (ADAPT centre in Trinity College Dublin). Even though COVID forced us to work remotely for most of my PhD, I still enjoyed being part of a network of PhD researchers, each tackling vasculitis from a different discipline or perspective.</p>
                
                <h2>Chapter 4: Health Data Science</h2>
                
                <p>After my PhD, I joined the Human Technopole in Milan (Italy) as a postdoc, working on child and maternal health with Luisa Zuccolo’s group. In the next posts, I’ll share more about this chapter, including how I went on to secure a MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship within a few months of joining in. </p>
